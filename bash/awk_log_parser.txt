Gawk now supports using regex patterns to define fields by using a built-in variable: FPAT

this will be very useful in parsing Apache HTTP log when fields like request_uri, user_agent are quoted 
by double-quotes.

    awk -v FPAT='[^[:space:]]+|"[^"]*"' '{print $6}' access_log

below a line in access_log,
::1 - - [04/Mar/2019:03:44:01 -0500] "OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0" 200 - "-" "Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) (internal dummy connection)"

print $6 will yield:

    "OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0"

This built-in makes it much easier to parse Apache log.
